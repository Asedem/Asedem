# Autoball (Car-Soccer)

This should not just be a <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/">Rocket League</a> clone, but an adaption of the "Autoball" series from <a href="https://www.prosieben.de/serien/tv-total">TV-Total</a>.
It should contain realistic car physics and the same rules, as in the TV show.

To get an overview about the Show and a few matches, here are some usefully links:
