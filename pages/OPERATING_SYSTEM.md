# Desktop
#### I used Windows and Kubuntu for a long time on my primary machine. Recently, however, I have become friends with EndeavourOS and will stay there for the time being.

# Mobile
#### My first phone was an IPhone 6, but as I wanted to program mobile application it forced me into Android. However, I still use an IPad, because I think Android sucks for tablets.
